# tic-tac-toe

_Introduction_
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game features a modular design with a focus on keeping global code to a minimum by encapsulating logic within objects and modules. Players can input their names, take turns to mark the game board, and see the game results displayed on the webpage.

_Features_
Gameboard Object: Stores the game board as an array and manages the board state.
Player Objects: Represent the players, storing their names and markers.
Game Controller: Controls the flow of the game, including checking for win conditions and ties.
Display Controller: Handles the rendering of the game board and user interface updates.
